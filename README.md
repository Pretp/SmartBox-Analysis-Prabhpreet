This repository contains all the code used for analysis. In order of importance: Correlate1.py (For STR-LCS Correlation), 
ruralvurban.py, cluster2.py (For K means clustering for outlier detection), and outliercalc.py, for other outliers in data.

In addition, I also did a time series analysis of the logins (results are attached as loginsperschooltime.png) but this did not lead to any significant insight or results.

Thank you for your consideration :)
